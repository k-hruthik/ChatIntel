# ChatIntel: AI-Powered Chat Transcript Analysis

Welcome to ChatIntel, a web application designed to provide deep insights into conversations by analyzing chat transcripts. Using the power of generative AI, this tool can summarize discussions, extract key information, and analyze the sentiment of the participants.

This project was created by [Hruthik Varma](https://github.com/k-hruthik).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Transcript Selection**: Easily load and select from a dataset of chat transcripts.
- **AI-Powered Summary**: Get a concise summary of any chat conversation with a single click.
- **Article Link Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts URLs for articles mentioned in the chat.
- **Agent-Specific Metrics**:
    - Calculates the number of messages sent by each agent.
    - Determines the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for each agent.
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: A clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface built with modern web technologies.
- **Modular AI Architecture**: Utilizes separate, specialized AI flows for each analysis task (summary, sentiment, link extraction) for better maintainability and accuracy.
